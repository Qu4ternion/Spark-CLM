# Spark-CLM
Revenue Optimization based on Churn Prevention and Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.) and Data Visualization techniques with Hyperparameter optimization executed on a distributed Spark cluster.

## Goals:
▪ Optimize revenue and cLTV (Customer Life-time Value).  
▪ Minimize customer churn (i.e. customers leaving the company).  
▪ Develop a churn prediction model for pre-emptive intervention.  
▪ Segment customers and detect the most profitable profiles to target.   
▪ Perform A/B testing to assess advertisement effectiveness.  

## Technologies :
▪ Spark, Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, numpy, Scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh, d3.js, http.server

## Methods :
▪ XGBoost, Ridge Regression, SHAP, GridSearch hyperparameter tuning, Kernel Density Estimation, Logistic regression, K-means, Cross Validation.  
▪ Student’s t-test, Welch test, precision/recall, f1-score, regularization.

## Data :
▪ 100,000 observations of a company's customer transactions, each comprising 20 variables collected from their app over the 2000 – 2021 period.   
▪ Pre-processing: data cleaning/wrangling, normalization, standardization, One-hot encoding.
